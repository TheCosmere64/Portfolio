Ingredients
</h1>
<p>
<ul>
<li>3 egg whites</li>
<li>3 tablespoons water</li>
<li>250g (9 oz.) caster sugar</li>
<li>pinch of salt</li>
<li>5 ml or 1 tsp vinegar</li>
<li>5 ml or 1 tsp. vanilla extract</li>
<li>1 tsp. cornstarch (optional)</li>
</ul>

============================================
</p>
<h1>
Instructions
</h1>
<p>
Step 1: Beat the egg whites and salt to a very stiff consistency. 
</p>
    
<p>
Step 2: Add water
and beat again before folding in caster sugar, vanilla and
vinegar. 
</p>
    
<p>
Step 3: Beat until the mixture holds its shape and stands in sharp
peaks. 
</p>

<p>
Step 4: Pour the mixture onto a baking sheet lined with parchment
paper. 
</p>
    
<p>
Step 5: Slow-bake the mixture at 150°C (300°F) to dry all the moisture
and create the meringue, approximately 45 minutes.
</p>


<p>This leaves the
outside of the pavlova a crisp crunchy shell, while the interior
remains soft and moist.</p>   
 
<h1>Tips and Tricks</h1>

<p>A trick to use (although untraditional) is to turn the
pavlova upside down before decorating with cream and fruit. </p>

<p>
This is because the
bottom is less crispy than the top after cooking and unless you seve
it immediately after decorating the "top" absorbs moisture from the
cream.
</p>
<p>
Another tip is to leave the pavlova in the oven after turning
off the heat - this helps to prevent the middle of the pavlova from
collapsing (although if it does collapse, generous application of
cream can hide any mistakes!)

afraid that it wasn't going to work, but when it came out of the oven
it looked perfect! Can't wait to try it again."

frustrating. First it didn't rise, then the edges got burnt. Maybe I
should stick to packet cakes..."
