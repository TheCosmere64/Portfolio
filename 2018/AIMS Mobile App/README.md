# Requirements to install
Below is a list of elements you will need to run this application on your system (development mode)
- Visual Studio 2017
- Xamarin extension for Visual Studio 2017
- Android Emulator (Version 26 to 28)

It may be possible to run it using other development environments, however this is unexperimented with and may not work completely.

# Running Instructions
The instructions for running will assume you already have Xamarin and Visual Studio 2017 installed on the target machine.
- Access the AIMS folder and open the AIMS.sln file contained within
- Visual Studio 2017 should open and show the project page
- Up the top of the screen will be a run button, make sure the boxes next to it are set to "Debug" "x86" and "AIMS.Android"
- Press the deploy (play looking button) up the top of the screen and if the emulation software is up to date it will launch the Android emulation with the app installed

This installation guide is only meant to be very brief, due to the installation of Visual Studio, Xamarin, Android emulators can be quite comprehensive, some issues that you may come across in deployment of the application can be solved by simply restarting Visual Studio or the emulation itself, others can be more troublesome and involve editing the BIOS on the PC.
