Nestled just a 10-minute walk from Brisbaneâ€™s CBD lies the Roma Street 
Parkland and Spring Hill precinct. A haven for the a la mode, Spring Hill 
features an assortment of trendy cafes and restaurants, interwoven with historical 
monuments such as the heritage-listed Old Windmill and the Spring Hill Baths.
<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile Roma Street Parkland offers a distinctly different experience, with 
designer gardens and sprawling lawns that wind around 16 hectares of stunning parklands. 
Well known by garden and plant enthusiasts for its exceptional horticultural standards, 
it is also a popular visitor destination, housing free barbeques, playgrounds 
and a year-round calendar of events.
